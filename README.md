We are trying to wotkout a "game" where every player is part of the infraestructure: No centralized server...

Each player starts with a two dimmensional rooms, where it has 4 doors, each door can lead to:

1 - Nothing(In this case, the player has the option of creating a new room.)
2 - Another player's room
3 - Own player room

The idea is that each room or set of rooms should be a representation of the player's view of the digital world, 
but not his/her actual view, but rather *what* he/she sees of the world, twitter streams, news, images that has received, etc.
The rooms should be both a place to explore others peoples versions of the world 
and a place where you can share how you perceive the world.

The code is still just an idea, an scribble.
