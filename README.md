We are trying to workout a "game" where every player is part of the infrastructure: No centralized server...

Each player starts with a two dimensional room, where it has 4 doors, each door can lead to:

1 - Nothing(In this case, the player has the option of creating a new room.)
2 - Another player's room
3 - Another owned room

The idea is that each room or set of rooms should be a representation of the player's view of the digital world,
but not his/her actual view, but rather *what* he/she sees of the world, twitter streams, feeds, etc.
The rooms should be both a place to explore others peoples versions of the world and a place where you can share how you perceive the world.

Is been built with akka and scalafx. We're still struggling with the right visualization. I really dont want to use 3D. It just feels wrong to try put a 3D world with 2-dimensional content in a 2-dimensional screen, so we need ideas...

The code is still just an idea, an scribble.
